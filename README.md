WordPress Helm Chart
This Helm chart deploys WordPress on a Kubernetes cluster using Helm, a package manager for Kubernetes. It includes the necessary templates to set up a Deployment, Service, and optionally, an Ingress resource.

Prerequisites
Kubernetes 1.12+ with Helm 3.0+ installed
Persistent storage provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure
Installation
To install the WordPress application on your Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

Clone this repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/sk1234567891/wordpress-test.git 
cd wordpress-helm-chart
Customize the values in the values.yaml file as needed. You can set the WordPress version, the number of replicas, and other configurations in this file.

Deploy the WordPress chart using Helm:

bash
Copy code
helm install my-wordpress ./wordpress
Replace my-wordpress with a suitable release name.

Make sure you have an Ingress controller set up in your cluster for the Ingress resource to work correctly.
